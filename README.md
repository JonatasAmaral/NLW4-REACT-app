<h2 id="what" > What is it </h2>

A React/NextJS app developed in a online event [NLW#4](https://nextlevelweek.com/) (Next Level Week, 4th edition), by the programming online school [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

<br />

### Easy and better

The app help you use the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to your work time, along with some gamification stimulus, and health care.

On each 25 minutes work section you finish, you unlock a challenge: an exercice for body or eyes, each give you some amount of XP points if completed, getting enought XP you will level up. Each level gets harder to reach.


You can check it running over [here](https://nlw-4-react-app.vercel.app/)

### What you will find in it

* Countdown _min : sec_ timer
* Completed challenges counter
* User info: picture, name and level indicator
* Experience bar indicator, with fine transitions
* XP value counter dinamicaly ajusting to bar size and boundaries.
  - It doesn't overflow
  - Align itself at right from bar' end when it is to small
  - Align itself at left from bar' end when it is to large
  - Perfer to keep it's middle on bar' end though
* Dinamic single button with icon
  - Pretty vivid themed start button
  - The button while running turns into a stop one. Clear flat on normal, strong red on hover
  - Small bar on button border indicanting time
  - Descriptive though disabled on time end, but not atempt to the challenge yet
* Persist user info on local machine by cookies
* Level up modal, with share button using native browser API, to share by any method (enabled over ssh only)
